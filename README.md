### Description

When a user enters a number this website will spit out the appropriate roman numerical value. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
You can open it locally within your computer by cloning the repository https://github.com/svealinnea/Roman-Numeral

Here are some instructions on how to do so:

You will need an internet browser & a code editor installed on your computer.
When you open the link above you will need to click on the "clone or download button".
After it downloads you will need to open the document labeled "Quiz.html"
You will then need to clone it on your computer via the terminal: git Clone (https://github.com/svealinnea/Roman-Numeral)
After you clone it you will need to open it in your preferred code editor.
Last step is to open it in a browser like Chrome, Firefox or even Safari (I would recommend using Chrome).
